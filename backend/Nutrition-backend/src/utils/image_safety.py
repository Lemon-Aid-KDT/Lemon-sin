"""Image safety utilities: metadata strip + decompression-bomb guard.

Two complementary defenses for user-uploaded images:

1. ``strip_image_metadata`` removes EXIF/XMP/IPTC/ICC payloads before any
   downstream consumer (OCR, learning storage, audit logs) sees the bytes,
   while preserving visible pixel orientation.
2. ``configure_pillow_limits`` + ``safe_load_with_bomb_guard`` cap pixel
   counts process-wide and escalate :class:`PIL.Image.DecompressionBombWarning`
   to an error so a small-on-disk image that decodes to hundreds of
   megapixels is rejected before the worker is OOM'd.

The utilities are framework-free; they intentionally avoid importing any
service or settings module to prevent circular imports.
