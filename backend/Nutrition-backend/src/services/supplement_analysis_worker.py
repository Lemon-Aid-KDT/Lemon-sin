"""In-process async worker for supplement image analysis (202 + poll).

When ``supplement_analyze_async_enabled`` is on, the POST routes pre-create the
analysis run row(s) in ``processing`` status, capture each image's bytes, and
hand off to one of the job functions here via :func:`asyncio.create_task`. The
job opens a FRESH request-engine session (``get_sessionmaker``), sets the same
owner-subject RLS context the request seam would (so owner reads/writes admit
under the Stage-2 ``lemon_app`` FORCE-RLS posture), runs the existing pipeline,
and flips the run to ``requires_confirmation`` (ready) or ``failed`` — all inside
the pipeline transaction so a partial ``parsed_snapshot`` can never be observed as
ready by a poll.

These jobs are detached background tasks, never awaited by the request: any
exception is logged and swallowed (never re-raised), and the failure path flips
the still-processing rows to ``failed`` with only a safe coded warning.
