"""Regression guard: every owner route must sit on an RLS seam before the flip.

After the FORCE RLS Stage-2 flip ``DATABASE_URL`` connects as the non-superuser
``lemon_app`` role. A route on the plain ``get_async_session`` dependency sets no
per-request RLS GUCs and commits owner/audit writes in-session, so under the flip
it silently fails closed (owner reads return 0 rows; ``audit_logs`` INSERT is
denied → 500). Owner routes must therefore either:

* use ``get_rls_context_session`` (dependency opens the request tx + sets GUCs), or
* keep ``get_async_session`` **and** wrap their body in
  ``rls_request_transaction`` / ``rls_request_transaction_allow_inner_commit``
  (needed only when the route schedules post-commit BackgroundTasks or calls a
  DO-NOT-TOUCH callee that commits + refreshes mid-request).

This test fails if any *new* route adopts ``get_async_session`` without being
added to the in-body-CM allowlist below — catching the exact class of bug that
left four supplement CRUD routes unmigrated until the live flip exposed them.
