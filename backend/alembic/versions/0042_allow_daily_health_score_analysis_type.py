"""Allow daily_health_score in the analysis_results type check constraint.

Revision ID: 0042_allow_daily_health_score_analysis_type
Revises: 0041_harden_ai_agent_chat_table_security
Create Date: 2026-06-12

The opt-in daily health score persistence (Settings.persist_daily_health_score,
decision #7) stores dashboard-computed scores as analysis_results rows with
analysis_type='daily_health_score'. The 0002 check constraint only allowed the
original three request-driven types, so the new value must be added before any
row can be written. No raw OCR text, provider payloads, or image bytes are
involved; RLS posture of analysis_results (0023b/0023c) is unchanged.
