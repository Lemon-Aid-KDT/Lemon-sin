# 2026-06-05 - Operator unblock runbook gate summary

## Summary

- The operator unblock runbook now summarizes both human-review queues and the
  downstream gates they block.
- The regenerated runbook keeps the same next batch focus while adding explicit
  brand DB import, OCR benchmark, and YOLO dataset gate status.
- The pipeline remains intentionally blocked until human review rows are filled.

## Updated Artifacts

| Artifact | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `outputs/generated/supplement-learning/2026-06-05/operator-review/operator-unblock-runbook.json` | Includes queue summaries and downstream gate summaries |
| `outputs/generated/supplement-learning/2026-06-05/operator-review/operator-unblock-runbook.md` | Includes `Gate Summary` Markdown table |

## Current Queue State

| Queue | Blank rows | Next action |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Brand/product review | 388 | Complete brand/product human review |
| Review-image PII screening | 215 | Complete review-image PII screening |
| YOLO section bbox annotation | 205 | Complete supplement section bbox review |

## Current Gate State

| Gate | Status | Allowed now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Brand DB import | `blocked_by_operator_review` | false |
| OCR benchmark / teacher OCR | `blocked_by_pii_screening` | false |
| YOLO section dataset | `blocked_by_annotation_review` | false |

## Safety

- No DB write was performed.
- No OCR provider call was performed.
- No LLM call was performed.
- No training job was started.
- Raw OCR text, provider payloads, local absolute paths, and product folder
  literals were not added to public summaries.

## Next Step

Start with the next operator batch recorded in the runbook:
`brand_product_review:001`. After that queue is filled and reconciled, continue
PII screening and YOLO bbox annotation. Do not run teacher OCR or PaddleOCR
training until the corresponding gates are green.
